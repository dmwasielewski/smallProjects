# toDoList

This code provides the following functionality:

- Users can add items to the list by entering a value in the input field and submitting the form.
- The application validates the user input to ensure it is not empty and displays an alert if the input is missing.
- Duplicate items are detected and the user is notified with an alert.
- The added items are displayed in the list on the web page.
- Users can remove items from the list by clicking the corresponding remove button next to each item.
- Removed items are removed from both the list and the local storage.
- Users can clear all items from the list by clicking the "Clear All" button. A confirmation prompt is displayed before clearing the items.
- The list can be filtered by typing in the filter input field. The items in the list are dynamically filtered based on the entered text.
- The filter input field is hidden when the list is empty, and it is displayed when there are items in the list.
- The application retrieves the items from the local storage and displays them on page load.
