# listElements


This code provides the following functionality:

- The user can click a button on a web page.
- Each time the user clicks the button, a new list element is added to an unordered list (ul) on the page.
- The content of the list element corresponds to a counter value that starts at 1 and increments by 2 for each new element added.
- If the counter value is a multiple of 3, the list element is styled with the class "big".
- The user can see the updated list of elements as they click the button.
