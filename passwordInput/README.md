This code provides the following functionality from the user's perspective:

- The user can enter a password into an input field on a web page.
- As the user types in the password, a message will be displayed indicating whether the password is correct and granting authorized access for a specific user.
- The user will see different messages based on the entered password, corresponding to different authorized users.
- The password comparison is case-insensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase characters are treated the same.
- If the entered password matches one of the authorized passwords, the corresponding message will be displayed in a designated area on the web page, and the input field will be cleared.
- If the entered password does not match any of the authorized passwords, no message will be displayed.
