# rectangleScrollSize

This code provides the following functionality:

- The user can scroll on a web page to trigger a visual effect.
- Initially, a green fixed-positioned bar is displayed at the top of the page with a height of 100 pixels.
- When the user scrolls, the height of the bar dynamically changes.
- As the user scrolls down:
  - If the height of the bar exceeds half of the window's height, the bar's color changes to red.
  - If the height of the bar reaches 0 pixels, the bar's color changes back to green.
- The change in height and color creates a visual effect as the user scrolls up and down the page.
