# JokeGenerator

This code provides the following functionality:

- The user can click a button or load the web page to generate a random Chuck Norris joke.
- There is a joke element on the page that will display the generated joke.
- When the user clicks the joke button or when the web page finishes loading, an API request is made to retrieve a random Chuck Norris joke.
- The retrieved joke is then displayed in the joke element.
- If there is an error during the API request or if the response is not successful, an error message is displayed instead.
